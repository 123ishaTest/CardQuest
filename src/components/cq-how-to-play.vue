    <p class="text-lg font-semibold">Introduction</p>
    <p class="text-lg">Card Quest is a Card Collection Game!</p>
    <p class="text-lg">Collect Cards, build your Deck, and go on Adventures!</p>
    <p class="text-lg">In this game you don't play against another player, or an AI. You play against the Level.</p>
    <p class="text-lg">The Level plays cards at certain turns. These cards are known beforehand so you can build
      your deck around it.</p>

    <br>
    <p class="text-lg font-semibold">Adventure</p>
    <p class="text-lg">Take your Deck and go on an Adventure.</p>
    <p class="text-lg">Battle your way through different Levels and defeat your enemies!</p>
    <br>
    <p class="text-lg">Whenever you perform an Action, the turn increases.</p>
    <p class="text-lg">The Level will Play certain Cards at certain turns</p>
    <br>
    <p class="text-lg">You can Play a card, to place it on the Field.</p>
    <p class="text-lg">Cards in the Field can be Tapped to interact with them.</p>
    <p class="text-lg">Cards can have costs to Play them, or Resources when they leave the Field (or both).</p>
    <p class="text-lg">You can use these Resources to upgrade your Tools and Weapons, or Play Action cards!</p>
    <br>
    <p class="text-lg">When you complete a Level, you gain some Cards to further improve your deck!</p>
    <p class="text-lg">More difficult Levels award rarer and better Cards.</p>
